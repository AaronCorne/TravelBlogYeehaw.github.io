            <h1>Oaxaca You Gem</h1>
            <p>Oaxaca. Don’t stress I had zero clue how to even approach pronouncing that before researching for this trip. Wa-ha-ca. speaking to some Mexicans prior to getting there we learned/learnt (which one idk) that Oaxaca is very very Mexican in the sense that there are a lot of legends relating to the founding of the country and other important cultural moments originating from this part. Notably, Mezcal comes from the region of and around Oaxaca so a very important drink originates here. It’s made from the Agave plant (which comes in many forms and thus many forms of Mezcal drinks) and is likened to a whisky-esque tequila sort of drink- many times told not to shot it but to sip on it.<br>
            
            <br>Oaxaca was just straight vibes. They love their rooftop bars partnered with live music which is also greatly appreciated by both of us and made the restaurants have a lovely ambience.  Spent the bday walking around the town which was a great way to get a lay of the land and just check everything out. Unbelievable colours on pretty much all the buildings made the town really pop and easy on the eyes whilst feeling like a really liveable town. We took a day to explore Hierve el agua which are waterfalls in the mountains just outside Oaxaca where we took a collectivo- which was like a modded Ute to fit around 10 people in the back up a bumpy asf road (was an experience). The place was pretty underwhelming for the first part until the end where we had to climb back up on a very steep and possibly very unsafe rock face that was concurrently very slippery from the residual waterfall. Nevertheless, was a cool experience and a fun day out.<br> 

              <br>Very vibey. Very cool.

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>Our first colonial town in Mexico. Oaxaca was the same Mexico you see in the movies. Colourful ceramic and stone buildings. Oaxaca was a town of rooftops and beautiful sunsets. Our roommate was held at gunpoint the day we arrived, so we were immediately on high alert. <br>

        <br> Street Artists, Craftsmen and beggars on each corner. This was our first introduction to poverty in Mexico. Some people seemed keen on earning your pity. Others were more keen to earn a tip, handing out Lollipops and other sweets. <br>

         <br>I really loved Oaxaca. A town I hope to revisit.
