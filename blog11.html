            <h1>Magic in the Yucatan</h1>
            <p>It was Yucatan time. After a delayed internal flight we got to Merida in the evening and walked around tryna find a place to eat which we found in a seemingly upmarket restaurant that did 2 for 1 pizzas which was obvs a no brainer. Merida was to be a base for day trips out to places like Chichen Itza, the Cenotes and going to the natural reserve to see flamingos. We had actually originally planned to do Chichen Itza by itself by going to Valladolid and spending one night before going up to Playa del Carmen. However, after a split decision at breakfast we decided to change it up and do the day trip from Merida which would allow a night in Tulum on the coast instead. <br>

             <br> Anyway, first day trip was to the natural reserve where we had to catch a collectivo again which resembled a large van that was like a cheaper alternative to a bus or maybe the only option. Experience in that was very akin to Ali Wazza in Sinai. Dropped off by the collectivo and had to get a tuk tuk to the park where the driver kept trying to sell us his tour guide package (to no avail). Tickets required a group of 6 to go out on the boat and by the time we got there we were the only ones waiting around except for a group of 6. After being told it’s not possible we walked to the actual boat and just asked the group as well as the boat driver to jump on if we paid then and there and voila we were on.<br>
             
             <br>Firstly a beautiful lake/body of water and secondly getting to see flamingos was actually very cool. Idk I think I’d always liked flamingos but never appreciated them but when you get to see them in their flocks there’s something siq about a bunch of pink birds and they look funny when they fly. Also saw a croc on one of the embankments as well as raccoons at the snack area that gave Jack a nice surprise. Ended the night by having a bangin falafel at an Israeli restaurant and watching a traditional dance of some sorts in the Zocalo (like a town square sorta but more vibey). Also was elite coz Chabad dropped off a Chanukah to light for the last night which was #spiritual <br>

              <br> Next day we shuttled off to Chichén Itza which were ancient Mayan ruins of a bygone era but one that is still intrinsically apparent in Mexico. The place had also been named as part of the New Seven Wonders of the world included with the likes of the Great Wall of China and Petra etc. This was the place where if you’ve seen that Facebook video/reel/tiktok is where you clap and the acoustics of the buildings manipulate the sound and create a sort of elastic band snapping sound with the echo of your clap. Bunch of clapped tourists were on the move taking their insta poses and whatnot and my camera decided to stop working which was a bummer. Saw the ancient sports arena where the game historically was to try and throw a ball through a small circular window high above on the wall. Plot twist tho, the winner /player that got the ball through was rewarded with being sacrificed to the gods. Imagine that. Ah yes good goal old chap, now your head please.<br>

              <br>Final day trip was to the Cenotes (Se-No-Tehs) which were these naturally formed water holes via asteroids that hit the earth ages ago. There are heaps dotted around the Yucatan but we decided to just head to the main area where we could get good bang for our buck. Had a lovely chat with Marisol in the front of the collectivo - in Spanish I might add- where she gave me her number because I may have alluded to wanting to buy a house in Merida after she revealed she was a real estate agent to keep the convo going. So if anyone is interested in buying a house in the Yucatan I’ve gotchu xx. The Cenotes were actually unbelievable, proper movie shit. The guy who took us on the tuk tuk to the first one tried convincing us that the life jackets were obligatory but we pushed on and whaddyaknow they weren’t. <br>
              
              <br>First Cenote had a ledge to jump in which was a lot of fun before moving onto a more touristy part that had 3 pools in one area. Was quite an open space and to get around you had to bike which I really enjoyed and was a lot of fun. The chain on my bike fell apart and then I lost my key to the lock on my bag but then I found the key but then my life jacket (which we needed this time) got stuck in the bike- it was a bit of a mess lol. Some of the most beautiful swimming locations I’ve ever been to.<br>

                <br>Absolutely went flat out the last couple of days but 100% worth every minute. Bh we were heading up to Tulum and Playa for some needed beach TLC to reset before Colombia.

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>Hard to articulate in a few sentences just how insane the last few days have been. Lucky Corney has done the elaborating on my behalf. Long story short, knowing locals in Mexico is a serious game changer. Elite food, bitta dancing, coupla smacks of the golf ball and far too many drinks. Can’t thank the Rivera family enough.
