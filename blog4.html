            <h1>The Three Musketeers</h1>
            <p>After waking up after a generous sleep in, the day started precisely at midday. We first hit the Walmart yet again for a build your own lunch and by the time we came out it was raining outside so we wanted to find a place inside to eat. In a move that would be hailed as abominable by OHS in Australia but the stuff of chutzpah legendary we asked a nearby cafe if we could sit and eat at their table if we bought a coffee. Not only did they say yes but they offered us plates to eat our food on lol. So we sat down with two grande cafe late con leche and whipped out our store bought baguettes and cheese and proceeded to have a lovely lunch meal. <br>
            
           <br> Afterwards we returned back to the park and museum that were closed on the first day of adventuring. We went to the Museum of Contemporary Art where they had this seriously unbelievable live performance as part of an exhibition. The performance was about 10-12 guys playing acoustic guitar singing a song all at different times but synchronising at points with beautiful harmonies. Truly left us both speechless for a couple of minutes- which in Jack’s case must’ve felt like forever. Was honestly a transcendental experience and really highlighted the distinct power that music can have. After walking around more of the museum we headed back into the park where there was a beautiful library next to the lake where we sought after a basic Spanish book to keep practicing. Post bookstore we ventured to el Castillo de Chapultepec which luckily had free entry. Even though the actual castle itself was closed, there was a lovely lookout to the rest of the city and was a nice vibe with lots of people flocking to catch the last bits of sunset.<br>
           <br>
            
            Walked back to the apartment and on the way bumped into these three older gents two of whom had guitars as well and proceeded to give us an impromptu performance after a short convo. Turned out they were singing and playing a specific genre of music from Oaxaca attributed to the Zapotec people. They joked they were the three musketeers and it was simply beautiful + another convo in Spanish for the books. Had to get our bags ready to take a weeks worth of clothes etc into a bag to be taken on the plane as we didn’t want to pay the outrageous fees for checked luggage on our flight to Guatemala. Went for dinner but was proper knackered and Ubered back which is worth noting because it was our first 15 minute length conversation pretty much all in Spanish which was really fun. Was also rewarding as the Uber driver complimented us on our Spanish which was pretty nice to hear.
            <br>
          <br>  I then thought it was a good idea to shave but unfortunately for me I had forgotten the different lengths of attachments for it so I only had the zero length which meant it was all or nothing. At first I thought i could shave without taking it all off but it was too painstainking so I just said fuck it and went clean. yeah look I cant say it was my greatest call as I now look like Id be mistaken for being younger than Jack and he pretty much just finished school. Adios por ahora.

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>A solid schloof. Went to the supermarket for brekkie around 1:30, before cycling to the contemporary art and music museum. Loved it. Went for a quick trot around the park and visited a historic castle, or “cahhhhhsle” as Corney calls it.  Another good one.</p>
