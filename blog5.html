            <h1>Absolutely Cracked Place</h1>
            <p>Today was our first proper crack in Lake Atitlan, Guatemala. The day before we had journeyed from the airport to our hostel - which funnily enough was owned by 3 aussies- which was a 3-4 hour Uber with Edwin the legend. This place would genuinely leave you breathless.<br>
            <br>A lake surrounded by volcanoes with small towns dotted around sets up this location as probably one of the coolest places Iâ€™ve been in my life. Not only is it an unbelievable place for its vistas but the actual people as well are so so nice and friendly. We first went to the town of San Pedro where of course one of the first things we see is a Chabad house so obviously venture in to say gday and end up wrapping tefillin which was actually really fulfilling and glad we did it. Went next door to a cafe that had Hebrew on it and was an Israeli cafe, and from then on found out that heaps of Israeli's frequently visit but for obvious reasons arenâ€™t here atm. Whilst at the cafe we underwent what could only be classed as the most typical Jewish thing ever as we soon got chatting with whoever else was at the cafe- with Jack finding out one of the girls was a cousins cousin as well as her and myself having mutual friends. Like fckn classic to a tee.<br>
            <br>Anyway after exploring parts of that town we then moved onto a nearby one called San Marco where there was an elite lookout spot with a 15m or so jumping ledge into the water which looked cool. There are heaps of aussies here so chatting to fellow travellers has been pretty easy. Sat down for a quick arvo lunch where a cat thought my lap looked comfy for a quick nap which I didnâ€™t mind and was cute. I actually think that part was in San Juan yet another town but more hippy and a bush doof partygoers wet dream.<br>
            <br>A very solid day that continued into a cool evening of essentially having pres with the owners of the hostel and their mates at one the nearby houses which was probably one of the coolest houses weâ€™ve seen so far before going to a local outside bar with music thing that was pumping Guatemalan techno. Was cool. Canâ€™t believe how good this little gem of a country is. More to come. Stay tuned.

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>Exceeded all expectations. Lake Atitlan is one of the most beautiful places Iâ€™ve visited. People are genuinely so friendly. We caught a boat from Pana to San Pedro where we discovered a Chabad House and a strip of Israeli cafes. We hung about for a while and I happened to bump into a distant cousin (who I had never met). Classic. Ended the day with an ice cream in San Marco before heading home.</p>
