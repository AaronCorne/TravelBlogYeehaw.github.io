As an avid traveller, I always journal my adventures to send my friends updates on what I have been up to. Traditionally, this meant that I would send broadcast lists with lots of photos and videos with a heap of text. Wanting to try my Web Dev skills out, I created a travel blog for my trip to Central and South America, starting the basic template on a computer and then updating the code for each entry using a coding app called Spck Editor. This Travel App placed a mobile first layout as all my friends and readers would be viewing this blog naturally on their phones.
