            <h1>Incomprehensible Silly Szn in Puebla</h1>
            <p>How to start? Genuinely no clue but will give it a shot. I’ll start with some context being that Jack met a Mexican family in Vietnam earlier this year who invited him (and me by association) to stay when visiting Mexico.
              La familia was the Rivera’s: Gerardo, Mari = the parents and Paola, Gerardo and Ivana = the kids. All total legends of the game. <br>

             <br> After keeping in contact with them, we had arranged to visit and had been generously offered by the Rivera’s to stay with them for a couple of nights on our Mexico travels. 

           After returning from Guatemala, we were very nicely picked up by Israel (the driver’s name not the country) and taken to Atlixco where we would be staying in probably one of the most beautiful houses I have ever or probably will ever see with my own eyes. We arrived in the evening and greeted by Maria and her husband Reuben who had prepared a delicious dinner that was waiting for us after we’d put our bags down in our respective rooms. While our heads were exploding at what was happening in front of our eyes we had to try and maintain some sort of calmness and respectability (although one would admit it was nearly impossible).<br>
           
           <br>After a delicious dinner of rice, tortillas and salmon steaks we were heading out to an Xmas party hosted by one of Ivana’s mates that was held on a ranch complete with at least 30 Spanish horses in their own stables. Jack and I obviously crushed the d floor while everyone else was milling about. This was also my first introduction to any member of the Rivera family so was nice to finally meet after hearing about them for a while. Also very cool that some of Ivana’s friends are doing exchange in Melbourne this coming sem and even more surprising is that they’re going to swinny so small world connections were made pretty quickly.  <br>

          <br>  Next day we lounged around outside in the gorgeous gardens while eating Maria’s best home cooked meals and enjoying the sunshine. We then set off to the town of Cholula (home to Jack’s fave sauce) to see the big church lit up on the tallest pyramid in the world (albeit a lot of it is in the ground) where we had drinks and pastries; Jack ate Ivana’s order by accident lol. The aim for the night was to go out clubbing but not before going to see a concert featuring the most famous Latin American singer and Mexico’s proudest singer: Luis Miguel. (They had tickets, we didn’t). Yeah look we had no clue who that was either. But after having no plan of action we decided to tag along going back to the Rivera’s house and meeting the rest of the fam. We then realised that we may have become a burden and tried backing out of them trying to help us get tickets to one of the most anticipated concerts of not only Puebla but of Mexico.<br> <br>Think cultural icon that has transpired through generations and you’ll get Luis Miguel. Anyway after a lot of chaos and with the generous help of the Rivera’s, Jack and I were ushered through the gate after getting wristbands slapped on us as our form of tickets. It happened in such a flash that only after getting through did I look and see that the wristbands were just red with the word STAFF on them hahahahha. So chest out and head up we confidently walked through all security and gates with the mere “nosotros staff” ("we [are] staff") and were left alone completely. What was this world. What was this life. <br>

            <br>The concert was like nothing else. Unbelievable vibes. Unbelievable tunes. 60,000 people all mesmerised by Luis Miguel. When he brought out a mariachi band I pretty much knew nothing could be topped. The night continued way past Jack’s bedtime as he fell asleep in the car on the way out of the concert as well as later on in the club. Important to note that he did lift and boogy with me for a solid few hours inbetween those two events. Fair play Jack. The club scene was very cool and didn’t feel as icky and slimey as previous clubbing experiences. You went to the bathroom and they had those guys handing out the mints and the paper towels!! Don’t reckon you get that @ revs. An absolute elite night of boogying before passing out at like 5 at the house. <br>
            
            <br>Pretty much rinse and repeat the next night but during the day we were taken by Gerardo snr (think suave Mexican James Bond) to the suburbs private topgolf range where we had a few hits + cervesas. Went out for dinner with Ivana and her friend Regina (Fregisol) who’s coming to swinny so that was cool. We were joined by Paola who was a lot of laughs and an excellent edition to the night out. An absolute send of a night with elite banter all round. Mari and Paola picked us up next day for our final farewell before taking a 6 hour bus to Oaxaca. <br>

           <br> Pictures/videos do the words more justice but genuinely will take a while to comprehend the last couple days. Couldn’t be more appreciative of the Rivera’s and am so glad we got to hang out with them. We’ve been saying that we have met such amazing people while travelling and they’re such a good embodiment of that. <br>
           

            <br>It’s not goodbye it’s just see ya later.

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>Hard to articulate in a few sentences just how insane the last few days have been. Lucky Corney has done the elaborating on my behalf. Long story short, knowing locals in Mexico is a serious game changer. Elite food, bitta dancing, coupla smacks of the golf ball and far too many drinks. Can’t thank the Rivera family enough.
