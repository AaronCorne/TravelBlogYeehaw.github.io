            <h1>Absolutely Cracked Place pt 2 & 3</h1>
            <p>Well howdy, this place just slaps. Thank god for my Shabbat friendly phone that took photos by itself coz it captured some unreal scenes post shule. Shoutout to my dad coz it was his parsha so was nice to be in shule for some pseudo torah reading from the Chumash which followed a generous feed of jachnun from the chanadniqs. Can appreciate that those couple of words might absolutely mean nothing to some readers but everyone’s welcome here. We press on. Post religious experience, we decided to explore more of San Juan which turned out probably had the most meat on the bone besides for the place where we were staying. This place was absolutely popping with colour on walls, street vendors and just an absolute explosion of culture and vibey feel. Also the street art here is so so cool, invocations of traditional clothing and practices displayed on walls surrounding made walking around the place so beautiful. Gorgeous day exploring and just kinda traipsing around the place made for a ripsnorter of a day. <br>
            <br>
            Went upstairs in the early evening and people at the hostel were kinda milling about drinking/starting to drink before going out. One of the hostel workers was another Melbournian so Obvs got a long pretty easily and before I knew it I had a beerbong in one hand and deleted a beverage rápido. Getting along with someone that works at a hostel and has access to booze was a pretty decent move on my part given when they got a beer, I too got a beer for free so that was great vfm. What this did mean however, was that I was completely off my tits at around 8pm while Jack was sleeping off an unfortunate stomach ache. Given that it was incomprehensible to go back to the room and just chill there I ventured out with the rest of the hostel gang. Pretty average night from then on but another solid one for the books.<br>

              Blog #7 <br>

<br />
What was siq about where we were staying was that there was a nice Aussie presence in the town so we started the day by going to one of the cafes that clearly had an influence from Down Under. Evident by the fact Jack had a smashed avo on toast with a chai latte in the middle of Guatemala lol. The day’s aim was to go check out the natural reserve that was near the place we were staying. Upon getting to the base of the mountain/hill we were genuinely starstruck by the view that sat at the bottom of this sort of hotel/apartment complex that was coupled with a soccer field and a pool. Interestingly, after speaking to a local we learned that there was no middle class whatsoever and only the haves and the have-nots. Was safe to assume which part of the lake we were currently in. <br>

<br>After taking the whole area in I really wanted to join in the game so started playing and kept rotating subs with Jack. Unreal experience and then just sat and looked at the view for about an hour and with melodic Latin music playing in the background it was pure paradise. We then walked up and around the natural reserve that had monkeys and armadillos in it- only just caught a glimpse of a baby monkey tho :(. Finished off the arvo by walking into a beautiful resort that was definitely not in a student price range and chupping their viewpoint before sitting down for a beverage. Night kept the unreal energies flowing as we went to a rooftop bar and started a boog with the dj that eventually turned into the whole bar joining in. What I absolutely love is how engrained dancing is in Latin American culture- and the freedom to just groove without a care in the world. Adios for now.

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>Woke up and caught the ferry to San Pedro to have some Jachnun at the Chabad House. In the arvo we walked through San Juan, a pretty colourful and festive town by the lake. I had a bit of a stomach bug in the evening so called an early one. <br>
           ——————————————————————— 
        <br>One of the best days yet. Walked to the nature reserve and had a kick of soccer with the panoramic backdrop of the lake and surrounding volcanos. Spotted a monkey hopping about before some afternoon cervezas and lemonade. Closed the day off with some Japanese and a dance at a rooftop Latin bar.
