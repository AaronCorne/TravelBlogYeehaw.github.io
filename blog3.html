            <h1>The Sun Is Hot</h1>
            <p>Today started off by trekking to a place called Teotihuacan, which was ancient city from the Aztec times around the 6th and 7th centuries. Was really awesome to see with our own eyes the ruins of a culture so distant from our own and one which we have zero connection with. What I really enjoyed about the ruins was that it was a very relaxed atmosphere in that we literally just walked wherever we wanted and weren’t beholden to a guide or it being too busy that we had to move quickly through the area. We did see a school trip pass by and they amused themselves by practicing their “hey bro what’s up” in an American accent on us. Our Spanish is getting sharper every day which is pretty cool to see as well as practice asking for directions etc but had a lovely chat with a lady on the bus to the ruins pretty much all in Spanish which was cool. <br>
            <br>
            If you’ve ever been on a student budget while travelling you know how invaluable a supermarket run lunch is. These largely consist of fresh bread- usually a baguette for value-, a spread or topping (for me usually cheese or tuna) and a packet of chips (usually spiced flavour to elevate the meal). Sometimes if you’re feeling fancy you add a pastry (which is what I did, opting for a chocolate croissant). So having all these we sat down for a hearty lunch and marvelled at how empty the place was and pondered on the history of where we were. Genuinely an unreal day trip and a must visit for anyone going to CDMX. <br>
            <br>
            Came back home and chilled for a bit before eventually going out for dinner with Nat coming out to meet us. Absolutely love the late night dinners and the relaxed nature of the nightlife. Both of us been saying that the city gives off a mixture of Barcelona and Hanoi vibes.
            
            A fully loaded day for a week that just keeps getting better and better. Yewwwww.

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>Today was top notch. Quick trip to the supermercado to kick it off, followed by a two hour bus ride to the 1500 year old city of Teothuacan. We made ourselves some tuna and chippie baguettes and explored the pyrimados amongst other ruins. <br>
        
        <br>Went back home to do some washing. We emptied our washing bags and the land lady explained that we must empty our pockets before putting clothes in the wash. I quickly reassured her this was “not my first rodeo”. After explaining the meaning of the phrase, I mentioned that I would add some more clothes when I took my shower. A tad impatient, the land lady asked me to get undressed on the spot so she could wash it all before I showered. Noticing my look of surprise she quickly reassured me that she had seen “plenty of naked bodies” and this was not her “first rodeo”. Lol.<br>
        
        <br> Corne and I then met up with Nat for some serious empanadas, con queso of course. 10/10 day.</p>
