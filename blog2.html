            <h1>Acclimating</h1>
            <p>Today started in unbelievable fashion with Jack questioning why the room was so cold as he had slept in a jumper and needed an extra blanket. This was utterly hilarious to me as I pointed out that he had not discovered the second layer of bed sheets and instead had just thought the flimsy top layer was all provided. The lady who’s house we’re staying in also lives here and is very pedantic about keeping the shower curtains inside the shower. Important context as I before I stepped in, she (lightly) roasted Jack who had showered previously for making a big mess with the water.<br>
            
            <br>Big mess was a bit of an overstatement tbh but yeah the lady is a fair bit cooked I would say. We were both starving so went to find some food which we quickly saw near the apartment. We got huevas ranchero con salsa y frijoles which is egg tacos with salsa and beans + a cuppa tea. Was decent to begin with but nothing special and then the waiter brought out another salsa which I was like sweet and forgot the most basic rule when you have an allergy which is to ask what’s in it. Yeah that’s right ya boy had an allergic reaction to the salsa on day uno coz they mix it with peanut sauce leshgo. Unfortunately the process is more frustrating given I knew what was to come which was head in a toilet bowl sorta scenario. Funnily enough or not so much for him, the food had also caught up to Jack and turned out we were both in need of ‘Los banos’ mucho pronto lol.  <br>
            
            
            <br>I had the deadly combination of whatever Jack was going through and the effects of an allergic reaction so I was pretty much out of action as much as Jack was. So here we were, first day and both of us absolutely written off to our beds. The state of it honestly. After we’d both had a rest we ventured to Chapultepec which has really cool museums that were all closed coz it was a Monday (?) idk either. Massive massive park though so we strolled around and saw a massive monument dedicated to Gandhi. There were bikes so we hopped on and went to the Zocalo which is like the centre part of the city and got elite churros from a street vendor before walking around some more and plonking down coz we were pretty zonked. Went for dinner at a vegan burger restaurant which was yeah decent but the chippies were banging. Sussed the Walmart for food tomoz coz we’re going on a day trip to some Mayan temple ruins which sounds pretty cool.

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>First full day. After enjoying some Huevos Rancheros and cold tea our stomachs did some readjusting. Without going into too much detail, we were pretty much wiped until the early afternoon. After we got over ourselves we headed to Chapultepec, a forest park in the centre of the city. We hired some bikes and headed into Centro which was an absolute vibe. Though I was quite surprised by the number of couples absolutely going at it, out in the open. Finished the day with some chippies and a toasted cheese, while the corne man munched down a veggie burger.</p>
