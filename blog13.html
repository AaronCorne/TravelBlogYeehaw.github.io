            <h1>Don't Say His Name</h1>
            <p>Medellin was one of the two cities which inspired this entire trip. Safe to say the bar was set high.

              Medellin was ridiculous, so ridiculous in fact, that I am happy to declare it as my favourite city so far.

              A bit of background. Medellin was ravaged by internal conflict and narcoterrorism from the seventies until the early two thousand’s. Pablo Escobar, who is colloquially known as ‘the criminal’ or otherwise ‘he who shall not be named’ (Voldemort style), was responsible for hundreds of shootings, kidnappings and bombings, which resulted in almost 50,000 deaths in the city. <br>

                <br>Colombians mostly hate him. We learned that the Netflix series is, though extremely entertaining, a very poor depiction of what actually happened. Nevertheless, Pablo is still popular in a particular neighbourhood, which was essentially built on the back of donations he made during his political campaign for presidency.

                Since the dismantling of different Cartels, Guerrilla groups and the Paramilitary, Medillin has lost its title as the most dangerous city in the world, and should instead be thought of as a paradise of culture, food, art, nature and history.

                Locals have worked so hard to change the reputation of the city and have done an incredible job in doing so.
                <br>

               <br> On the first day, we dumped our bags, had some tacos and went out. We danced salsa in a Cuban bar, next to some local legends. We then went to a regatone club and eventually called it a night.

                The next morning we woke up early and did the Medellin free waking tour. Some unreal insights into history and culture in the city. I especially liked the Franz Botero square, where we found these funny and disproportionate sculptures of different people and animals. Rumour is if you touch the sculptures you’ll find your soulmate, or otherwise be gifted with seven years of good sex. Will keep you posted on that one lol.
                
                  In the arvo, we checked out Communa 13, formerly the most dangerous neighbourhood in the city. It has since been done up with symbolic street art and is home to hundreds of street vendors and bars. Super colourful place and an amazing spot to watch the sunset over the hilly city.

              The cool thing about Medellin, is it’s built into the mountainside. Wherever you are, there is always an insane view, either of the city above or the city below. See the pictures for reference. <br>

              <br>On the second day we visited Escobar’s grave as well as the place where he was finally killed. In the arvo we took the cable car up the mountainside with two Dutch mates from our hostel, ate some choccy strawberries and did a short hike together. This was a pretty remote part of Medellin and I’m pretty sure we were the only tourists. Nevertheless we still managed to find a couple of Israeli’s at the bottom of the trail. Small world.

              I had heat stroke later that night, so I sent Corney on his dancing way, while I passed out in my bunk. <br>

           <br> Day three in Medellin was a ripper. I woke up pretty early and went for a walk. My goal was to get to a suburb called Laureles. I started walking, but eventually hopped in an Uber when I started feeling a little lost.

            Corne dog joined me a bit later on and we smashed some French toast and Scrambled eggs. After a quick stop at the supermercado, we caught the colectivo to Santa Fe De Antioquia, which was recommended to us a lady I spoke to on the metro the day before. Coolest town you’ll ever see. Absolutely no tourists. The town was full of Colonial buildings with the most colourful doors I think I’ve ever seen. We sat down for a coffee at a local joint which was apparently quite famous. And for good reason. We wandered around for a little longer before heading back to the station. A bus was pulling out just as we arrived and we quickly hopped on.

            That night we had dinner a Peruvian place, before a quick guitar sesh in the basement of the hostel. We packed and called it an night. <br>
            
            <br>We set our alarms for 2:45 AM, as we had an hour drive to the airport before our 6 AM flight.

            I woke up the next morning, rolled over to check the time, and jumped up when I realised we had overslept and it was already 3:16. I woke Corney up in a flurry and we rushed to get our belongings together, before running downstairs and hopping into our cab. <br>

           <br> Our one hour drive to the airport took us exactly 18 minutes. Our cab driver must have thought he was James Bond because my man was bombing red lights, running 110 km/h in a 30 zone and overtaking cars in a one lane tunnel. Made our flight comfortably and off we went.

            <p>The roof where Pablo was killed. I found it so crazy that it was just above a cafe- it was just another roof- no special plaque, nada. Fun fact as well, when shooting Narcos, they couldnt get the rights to use that roof so moved two doors down on a near identical one.  </p>

        <h1>CORNEY'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>
          Touching down in Colombia was not only exciting but marked a pretty cool and momentous time for me in 2023. Colombia was now my 20th country visited in the calendar year whilst also signifying the 4/5 continents ive visited- Bshana Haba b'Antarctica. Ok enough boasting (I am in fact very grateful and appreciate the priviledge of being able to do extensive travelling). Medellin simply has the goods- the people, the history, the art. On every street corner something interesting appears. Taking the free walking tours as well as the Escobar tour- we learned more in depth about the tapestry that is Colombian + Medellin history and it's ongoing repercussions and efforts for civil upheaval. <br>
          <br>
          For our first taste of South America, Medellin sure showed up and their nightlife scene was unlike anything I'd seen. The main club area called Provenza just kept spilling out into more open areas and created an unreal atmosphere- just make sure you take a taxi back to the hostel. Met a guy who had his phone taken and lost 125k in crypto rip. <br>
          <br>
          To top it all off, we were walking back in the arvo and came across a futsal court with a couple of people playing. This was not an opportunity I was going to miss. We hopped on and had a 40 minute run-around which ticked my box of playing football with locals in South America- fckn siq. Obviously we schooled em and sent em to the tienda for some leche.
