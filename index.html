<!-- AIM-->

<!-- The aim of this blog post is both a record journal as well as a personal project to keep practising my webdev skills with the aim of hopefully getting a job somewhere and sometime in the future -->
<!-- Some aspects of this website i would like to include are: an updatable page with updatable figures, where the most current day of both is on the first page whilst there is an archival of past entries
i also would ike to feature a comment section potnetially for friends to leave comments
i would also like to somehow be able to edit and enter new content while being away from a computer as to keep the actual blog post alive
potentially a way to ensure the webpage doesnt explode everytime i insert new data would be to make a limit in a flexbox of X amount of pictures -->

            <h1>WELCOME</h1>
            <p>This is the homepage of my very first (non-uni) and probably very glitchy website that is a <em>Travel blog</em>!!! <br>
            <br> Now, I know exactly what you're thinking-  "i aint readin all that. I'm happy for u tho. Or sorry that happened" and ya know that's pretty fair play. Not sure how much I would read someone's travel blog- who gives a shit? <br>
            <br>So if you do decide to stick around and read these entries then I would be very grateful and appreciative of you taking time out of your day for me. And if not, I hope wherever you pee it is windy.

                Essentially, my aim for this website is to document my upcoming travels to Central and South America by posting descriptions of each day with (hopefully) some funny + ridiculous stories of adventure. <br>
                <br>- I am joined on my exploration by Jack 'Moshe' Davis who tbf had his whole trip planned out and I just jumped on the bandwagon for (eek). Subsequently, I would buckle up for some seriously hilarious tales and faux pas' (mostly by Jack I'm sure) <br>
                <br>- My aim for the structure of this website is to have the homepage stay the same with all this info, and then have the next page contain the most recent entry and the ultimate page display an archive that accesses all past entries. <br>
                <br>- All these capabilities are found in the navigation bar at the top of the page<br>
