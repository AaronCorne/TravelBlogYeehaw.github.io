            <h1>Unforgettable Hike on a Volcano</h1>
            <p>A big 1. Today we were travelling to Antigua to stay one night before hiking up to Volcano de Fuego, pretty much one of the major attractions to travelling to Guatemala in the first place. This hike would be an overnight stay at the top of one of the adjacent mountains to the Volcano itself. After travelling via shuttle from our hostel in Lake Atitlan into Antigua we walked around the town with two chicks from Barcelona who were cool and helped us with our Spanish and went with us to the supermarket to buy snacks and water for our adventure. The supermarkets make it hard not to boogy when you’re looking for shit like dried fruit and protein bars coz their soundtracks are all such bangers. <br>
            
            <br> Anyway, we woke up the next day to start our ascent to the mountain. There was a large group of us I’d say about 20 people with a large contingent of Canadians who were quality to talk to. Also trust there was an Israeli haha as well as this 60-something Iranian guy called Karim who was an absolute jet and made the hike look like a walk in the park. The hike itself was quite physically challenging but easily the most rewarding experience. We had great visibility going up and the terrain kept varying as well so it was quite cool to kind of walk through different biomes (thank u yr9 science or history for that word). Hiking amongst and then above the clouds was extraordinary and when we got to base camp there was a beautiful full view of the volcano that had started erupting just as we were making our way to the cabins. Simply breathtaking. <br>
      
            <br> After some of the best cuppa soups I’ve had we put our packs down and continued onto the actual volcano to see the eruptions up close and personal. Ya boy probably should’ve dressed more appropriately and next time will invest in either buying or renting proper hiking shoes coz at times it was like walking on ice the amount of times I slipped. Also I wore shorts. If you looked at everyone around me, they were definitely not wearing shorts. But to be completely honest the only cold part was when the wind was threatening to throw you off the mountain and my hands did get cold. Sitting under the stars with such a clear night waiting for a glimpse of the electric oranges and reds spewing from the mountain was peaceful and once the volcano vomited it was truly a magical experience. <br>
          
            
            <br>The schlep down was reminiscent of finishing a Friday night dinner at someone’s house far away and knowing you have a long walk ahead of you. A physically enduring challenge but one I absolutely loved. 4am wake up and hike to the top of the mountain base camp was in was thankfully scrapped after seeing how foggy it was in the morning. Ascent down was equally as challenging and I was on extra alert not to slip and muddy my pants but getting to the bottom and reflecting on the achievement of the hike felt euphoric. Easily one of the best experiences of my life and am so glad we got to do it. <br>


              <br>This pretty much wraps up Guatemala and shall be heading back to Mexico for a couple of weeks to see what else it has to offer. Keep ya eyes peeled xx

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>Once in a lifetime is possibly an understatement. A tough 8 hours of trekking rewarded us with a close up view of an active volcano, which exploded 6-7 times before our very eyes! One of earth’s best party tricks. As we returned to base camp, it was dark, windy and absolute freezing. Amongst the coldest I’ve ever been. Just as Volcano was about to disappear from our line of site it erupted one last time. <br>
    
        <br>
        The biggest and best one yet! Back at base, we smashed a couple of hot chocs and marshmallows around the campfire. As we went to bed in our little shacks, we heard a big boom, much louder than the other eruptions. The wind picked up again and truly felt like we were about to fly off wizard of oz style. All up the hike was 27km, 4000m elevation. Despite the ashy lungs we had on the way down, the experience and people we met along the way were absolutely worth it. That was elite. </p>
