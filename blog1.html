            <h1>Well Worth The Wait</h1>
            <p>We open with an absolute blood pumping spring to make my first (of three) flights to get to Mexico. In a rush I looked at the departures board and mistook my flight to Sydney as closing in 2 minutes so Obvs rushed and once I got there it had closed and was like Aw feck. Then I was like hang on this isn‚Äôt the brand of airplane I‚Äôm flying lol. Then once I got to Sydney I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt have enough time to checkout get my bag and then check back in into the international terminal to get to LA. Waited in a bag drop line for what felt like an eternity and finally cleared customs etc and got on the plane. Went relatively smoothly apart from the baby in the row in front literally not not screaming every single hour. And I mean like scream screaming like kawwwww ü¶Ö. <br>
            <br>
            Anyway managed to get there fine and then had time to check my bag in and chill before catching my flight to Mexico. Jack was taking an earlier flight so he was also in the airport so managed to see him for a brief second or too which was cool. Asked the check-in chick if I could jump on their flight and she was like ah if you hadn‚Äôt checked in luggage and I was like ahh yeah fair. Walked around a fair bit trying to decide what I wanted to eat and landed on a cheese toastie which was wildly wildly overpriced. Still, a good toastie is a good toastie.<br>
            <br>
            Fast forward to actually getting to Mexico: met back up with jack and was picked up by Nat who I met way back in Venice who is a #legendofthegame She gave us a ride to our room which is in this 1940s triple story apartment house thing which is so fucken siq. We dropped our bags and then went out for a late dinner: Mexican edition. Genuinely unreal food as you‚Äôll see in the piccies below and overall an elite cultural experience. Completely changes the game when ur living it up with the locals. After dinner we went to see if we could go to a rooftop bar but due to it being a random Sunday night it was closed. Fortunately, nearby was a dance ‚Äúclub‚Äù not really the right word for it coz it was an apartment and was semi pumping (again for a Sunday night) but could tell it would pop off on a satdie night.<br>
            <br />
            Absolutely jammed out for at least an hour during which I needed the bathroom. Now in English speaking countries M= male, F= Female. Having just stepped off the plane and not clicked into duolingo mode I went straight for the M bathroom because, yeah. Forgetting that M in Spanish stands for mujer= woman. So I heard like banging on the door and was muchos confused and when I came out was stopped by the seccy who was like wtf are you doing (assuming coz he was talking rapid espa√±ol). Great times, great people and great start.</p>
