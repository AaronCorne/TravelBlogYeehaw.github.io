            <h1>American Surfers</h1>
            <p>Playa playa playa. Well if we thought Tulum was the 53rd state of America, this place pretty much screamed red white and blue. Getting off the bus my first thought was that the place resembled a Surfers-esque vibe, main strip was called 5th avenue and was a more clean less grungy Caville ave I’d say- packed full of bars, fast food stores and every trinket seller ever. Anyway, we had opted to stay in an Airbnb for this part of the trip which was very welcomed as a means to rest without feeling hemmed in and being able to stretch out.<br>
                
              <br>  As we walked parallel to the beach we started wondering if the influx of Americans would partner any kosher/Jewish institutions. Passing the Chanukia and the Xmas tree this wondering started to consolidate eventually being confirmed when the restaurant underneath the Airbnb complex was called Moshe Cube and the words “kosher Mediterranean grill” underneath it. Genuine euphoria. Month without meat was about to be put to rest and we just couldn’t be happier. Mad respect to our vegetarian personas when travelling but we needed to put that on hold for now.<br>
                
               <br> Next couple of days were filled with just chilling, eating unreal food, swimming in rooftop pool and just re-energising. A perfectly timed intermission on exploring whilst still having an unbelievable time. <br>
                
               <br> We also found a washing machine in the apartment so we got to do our washing which not only was a win for us, but seemed to please our mothers. <br>
                
               <br> Bring on Colombia.

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>I loved our time in Playa. We rented a little beachside apartment, cooked up a storm for Brekkie each morning and just lounged around for a few days. We even had our own washing machine! Absolute win.

The greatest surprise about Playa was the plethora of Israeli restaurants. We ate Shawarma, Kuba, Shnitie sandwiches and sipped Limonana. <br>

<br>Playa Del Carmen is essentially a US travel oasis. Geographically Mexican, Spiritually American. Starbucks, KFC, 7/11 and Maccas everywhere. 

Almost no one spoke any English everywhere else we’d visited in Mexico… but Playa was an absolute bubble. <br>
<br>Absolutely everything was in English and you’d be hard pressed to practice your Spanish anywhere.
Not really my speed as a destination, but was an unreal opportunity to reset, eat and relax. </p>
