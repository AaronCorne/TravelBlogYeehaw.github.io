            <h1>Tulum surprises</h1>
            <p>We caught an early bus to Tulum which is on the coast and instantly felt a wave of Americana/ tourist presence more than ever before. The contrast was pretty crazy coming from Merida and Oaxaca where yes there was touristic elements but not quite like Tulum. It sort of felt like a classic beach town that had recently come into money and had set up hotels for a family feel Mexican holiday. <br>
            
            <br>What I really enjoyed was that the main form of transport for visitors was bicycles and it’s always fun exploring the beach town on a bike with a basket on the front and feeling like a Hollywood sweetheart in a Romcom on their way to whatever and “bumping into an old flame”. Oath what was that tangent (?), heat must be getting to me. Rented out bikes and got down to the beach which was simply idyllic. Crystal blue waters amid beach clubs as well as fully armed policemen with bigboy guns™️ patrolling the beach. I felt very safe on my beach run before jumping into the water which was unreal. Chilled on the beach for a while before making our way back to the hostel to clean up and go for dinner at an Italian joint with a live band that was across the road that was really really nice to listen to- we’d heard some live bands on this trip and not all of them have been notable lol. <br>
            
            <br>Next day we went to the Mayan ruins that were by the beach that had the bluest most Instagram influency water you’ve ever seen but was really busy. Saw some huge Iguanas just chillin on the rocks or on the actual ruins. Ripper weather day before catching the short bus to Playa del Carmen which was very much needed to just chill and hopefully find a place to do some washing coz ya boiz were down to the last vestiges of clothing.

        <h1>JACK'S 2 CENTS</h1>
        <p>A quiet little beach town on Mexico’s southern Yucatan Peninsula. We rode bikes, lounged by the beach and explored ancient ruins. Not to mention our little encounter with the ‘dude’. Ask me about when you see me :)
